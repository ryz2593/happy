/**
 * 27.
 * Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
 * <p>
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * <p>
 * The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
 * <p>
 * Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
